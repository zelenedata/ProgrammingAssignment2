## Caching the Inverse of a Matrix



## This function creates a special "matrix" object that can cache its inverse.

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
              m <- NULL
              set <- function(y) {
                     x <<- y
                     m <<- NULL
                     
              }
              get <- function() x
              setSolve <- function(solve) m <<- solve
              getSolve <- function() m
              list (set = set, get = get, setSolve = setSolve, getSolve = getSolve)
  
  
  
}


## This function computes the inverse of the special "matrix" 
## returned by makeCacheMatrix abothen cacheSolve. 
## If the inverse has already been calculated (and the matrix has not changed),
## then cacheSolve should retrieve the inverse from the cache.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
         m <- x$getSolve()
         if(!is.null(m)){
                message("getting cached data")
                return(m)
                
         }
         data <- x$get()
         m <- solve(data, ...)
         x$setSolve(m)
         m
         
## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}
